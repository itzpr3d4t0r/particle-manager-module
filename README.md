# Particle Manager
This Cpython module aims to deliver a fast particle manager by avoiding having to deal with individual particles in python.

# Installation
You can either run this command once you navigate in the project's directory:

`py -m pip install .`

or run the `setup.py` module directly with the following extra args:

`build_ext --inplace`

This will create a `build` directory and a .pyd file packaging the library.
